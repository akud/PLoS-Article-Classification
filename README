This is the code for my final project in Stats 132 at UC Berkeley (Practical Machine Learning)

The goal is to use machine learning algorithms to classify scientific articles in to subjects using data from the publicly available PLoS search API (http://api.plos.org).

The python code is used to pull down articles from PLoS and format them into vectors.  It is gradually being assembled in to a decent project structure, and eventually will include the classification algorithms.

The R scripts are built to facilitate investigation and contain some (poorly implemented) machine learning algorithms.
